# geofetch

_with apologies to the neofetch maintainers and SNK Corporation_

A system information utility for an extremely small subset of people.

## WTF?

It's a "system information" utility in that it _does_ show some system information, but in a format inspired by the classic NeoGeo boot screen. Your system's RAM size in _mega, giga or terabits_, and your OS. That's it.
